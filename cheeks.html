        <h1>HAPPPY BIRTHDAY LAILA</h1>

    <div class="box">
        <h2>Main purpose</h2>
        <p>This website I'm creating is just for practice and other reasons which are most 
            likely not a secret and are being displayed by the website it's self... sigh I'm reading this 
            with a heavy heart but I'm not getting into that right now i just want to show my affection.
            So im making this website as a birthday gift to the woman i love laila,Her name really is so speacial to 
            me anyway i don't know why but i just like it she made me so happy in the past month without being with me phyically
            i think what i have for her is true love because even knowing she has imperfections i still want her but recently things
            have been going bad she has a new guy  and she still
            talks to me and shows love to me i was really confused at first but i realised she really needs me so i decided to move
            away from my family and friends to be with her, I really hope we end up together i love her.

    <div class="box2">
        <h4>Songs</h4>
        <p>I was going to make a different genres of songs but remember that she likes any genre of song it really just has to song good and she'll like it,
            she likes songs that may seems childish to some people but i think it's really cute and precious well to me anyway,
            she also recommended some great artists to me i never thought l'll listen to those songs in the gym but it's like a way to be closer to her
            to be honest if she started singing l'll be her #1 fan.

        <h4>Food</h4>
        <p>Her food choices are really great she loves ramen like me and can cook some delicious looking food 
        and can bake,she likes to make dumpings which turn out great and I'm not gonna lie i really have no idea how she makes them look so perfect 
        her hand preciseness must be really good(she has the most prettiest hands I've seen) I really want too see her eat her favourite dishes i want to see the expression on her face
        i bet it'll be the cutest thing i have ever seen.

        <h4>affections and attentions</h4>
        <p> This must seem basic in a relationship but with laila it's different she want u to make her feel like the only girl in your life which might
            seem bad but she'll make it seem like your the only guy in her life she's care for u and ask if ur okay or not and make u feel comfortable,
            You should treat her like a princess and be able to make time for her and tell her if your busy or not because communication is a very important key with her
            tell her anything even the small things thet seem unimportant she'll apprecite it a lot and having her happy is the best thing u can do trust me 
            your day will not go well if she's mad at you you'll miss her so much that's the effect she had on me.
